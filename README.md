# todometer

[Cassidy Williams built todometer](https://cassidoo.co/post/todometer-build-log/) as "a meter-based to-do list". This repository is meant to recreate the application to practice with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), but mostly to learn [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/).

## sveltekit

Sub-folder used to design the application and develop the basic logic with [SvelteKit form actions](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/form-actions).
